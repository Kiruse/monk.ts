Monk is a very opinionated MongoDB abstraction library designed to leverage MongoDB's innate flexibility.

As a document-based database, thinking exclusively in schemas and tables seems archaic. Certainly, that line of thought has its place in a document database as well, but the coexistence of differently shaped yet related documents within the same collection unlocks new possibilities that are impractical with tabular/relational databases. The mere fact alone that MongoDB only rudimentarily supports transactions requires a paradigm shift for developers venturing from a relational database system.

This library is a WIP that I'm using in my other projects. Sorry.
